State Code - FIPS code referring to which state the monitoring station is in
County Code - FIPS code referring to which county the monitoring station is in
Site Num - unique identifier (within counties) for the monitoring station
Address - address of the monitoring station
State - the state the monitoring station is in
County - the county the monitoring station is in
City - the city the monitoring station is in
Date Local - date of when the data for that day was summarized (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
The 4 pollutants - NO2, O3, SO2, CO
Pollutants recorded in PPB (parts per billion) - NO2, SO2
Pollutants recorded in PPM (parts per million) - O3, CO

Each pollutant has 5 features attached: 
the units used for that pollutant (either PPM or PPB) -> PollutantName+Units
the average concentration of that pollutant for that day -> PollutantName+Mean
the highest concentration for that day -> PollutantName+1stMaxValue
the time of day when the highest value was recorded (using 24-hour time system) -> PollutantName+1stMaxHour
the air quality index of that pollutant for that day -> PollutantName+AQI (however, some pollutants, like SO2 and CO, only
half of the rows have values for this feature, may end up dropping this feature)

Possible path for the project - time series problem -> remove features that aren't important to the prediction -> handle the missing values -> decide on how to build the model
